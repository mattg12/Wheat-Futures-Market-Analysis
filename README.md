# Matt Garton: Wheat Futures Market Analysis

**Context**: The ultimate goal of my project is to develop a trading strategy for commodity futures, which will include both prediction modeling to identify price patterns and trading opportunities as well as a rules-based algorithm to make trading decisions and manage risk.

### Goals:
1. Analyze historical time series data to understand underlying trends, distributions, and patterns.
2. Use a variety of modeling techniques, including time series regression models and LSTM neural net approaches, to predict future price movements in commodty markets.
3. Develop models which can support trading decisions by classifying predictions into more general market 'regimes.'

### Technical Report:

Refer to [technical report](https://github.com/mattg12/Wheat-Futures-Market-Analysis/blob/master/Technical%20Report.md) for full discussion of research and modeling.

### Technologies Used:

All analysis was performed in a Anaconda Jupyter Notebook and written in Python 3.

1. Data: [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
2. Visualizations: [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
3. Modeling: [Statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html), [Keras](https://keras.io/)
